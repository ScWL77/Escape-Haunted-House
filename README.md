# Escape-Haunted-House
IM2073 Game Programming Mini Project

This is a first person single player game where the user will have to escape the haunted house, which has two levels, through portals without dying to the enemies such as a creepy snowman and another self-created AI monster. C# programming was used to code the scripts in this game. Unity starter and online free assets were used to create the game as well as references from youtube tutorial videos to learn how to build certain parts of the game in Unity.
